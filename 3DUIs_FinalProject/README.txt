Special Instructions for Deployment: None

Instructions for Using App:

- Please use the "can", "stones", "acid", and "lego" Image Targets from Assignment 3.

- We also provided the database (cylinder database) and PDFs for the other two cylinder targets (cylinder 1 and cylinder2).

Missing Features:

Bugs in the Code:
- Sometimes the app is glitchy because of the somewhat poor tracking on the cylinder targets
